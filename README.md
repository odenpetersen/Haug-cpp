# C++ Haug

Translating VBA code from Espen Gaarder Haug's classic book [The Complete Guide to Option Pricing Formulas](https://www.amazon.com.au/Complete-Guide-Option-Pricing-Formulas/dp/0071389970) in C++.

Please read the book for explanations of the formulas themselves and their parameters.

This project mostly attempts to conform to [Google's C++ Style Guide](https://students.cs.byu.edu/~cs235ta/references/Cpp%20Style/Google%20Cpp%20Style%20Guide.pdf), but this is not guaranteed. Variables are often renamed (i.e. differently to the book) for clarity.
